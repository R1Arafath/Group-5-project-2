# Project Description: 
This project explores MTA ridership recovery trends from 2020 to 2025 using public transit data from New York City. By visualizing changes in ridership across subway, bus, commuter rail, and paratransit services, we assess how different transportation modes have rebounded from the COVID-19 pandemic. The analysis highlights significant gaps in recovery, particularly among services relied on by vulnerable populations, and offers insights into the economic, social, and policy implications of transit usage in a post-pandemic world.

The project focuses on seven key MTA transportation modes: Subways, Buses, LIRR, Metro-North, Access-A-Ride, Bridges and Tunnels, and the Staten Island Railway, addressing two main questions:

How have MTA subway and bus ridership recovered compared to pre-pandemic levels?

Which transportation mode has had the slowest recovery post-COVID, and how does it compare to others over time?

Using Tableau for analysis, we created trendline visualizations comparing each modeâ€™s annual recovery as a percentage of its pre-pandemic baseline. Findings show that while Bridges and Tunnels quickly surpassed pre-2020 levels, modes such as Access-A-Ride and the Staten Island Railway remain significantly below full recovery. These results emphasize the need for informed transit policy, equitable investment, and targeted support for underserved communities.
